# This YAML file defines a Kubernetes Deployment that demonstrates how to use the built-in 'autopilot-spot' ComputeClass in GKE Autopilot.
# The built-in 'autopilot-spot' class is a simple way to run workloads on Spot VMs without defining a custom ComputeClass.

      # The nodeSelector is used to request a specific ComputeClass.
      nodeSelector:
        # This selects the built-in Autopilot Spot compute class.
        # GKE will schedule these pods on nodes that are Spot VMs, which are provided at a lower cost than standard VMs but can be preempted.
        cloud.google.com/compute-class: "autopilot-spot"

      # --- HIGHLY RECOMMENDED FOR SPOT PODS ---
      # When a Spot VM is about to be preempted, GKE sends a notification.
      # `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` gives your pod a chance to shut down gracefully.
      # The default is 30 seconds, but for Spot pods, it's recommended to set it to a value that allows for cleanup,
      # but is not too long, as the node will be terminated regardless. 25 seconds is a common choice.
      terminationGracePeriodSeconds: 25
